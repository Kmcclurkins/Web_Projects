                <h2>Movie Number 2!</h2>
                <p>Their other movies continued from the first with a huge plot twist. They still keep the same actors
                    to keep the story alive, except Isla Fisher, which was pregnant during the filming of the second
                    movie.
                    So they replaced her with Lizzy Caplan. For the new movie that was released November 14, They
                    brought
                    back all the actors from the previous movies and they all go on a crazy adventure. And the new movie
                    is named 'Now You See Me, Now You Don't.'</p>
