            <h2>Can YOU Make History?</h2>
            <p>Anyone can make music. If you know what you want to sing about and what you want to look like, You CAN Do
                It! One thing that most people don't get is that music takes time. Music is art and the more you spend
                time on it the better it will get. Tell your story by making a song about it, you may find your new hobby and make it to the top! </p>

            <p>To make a song you need to write lyrics and have a beat to sing them to. You don't need fancy equipment, you can make a simple song off of your phone! Its easy to find new beats and make a simple song from your phone, and don't think that since you are making music you need a microphone and intruments. Most great music artists now started by just using a phone or a computer, and some didn't know how to play an instument! Give music a try. Tell Your Story. Find people who you relate to. Then you'll see that creating music isn't that bad, it just takes time. </p>
